I discussed the exercise with: Amit Tropp, Eyal Cohen

=============================
= README for ex10
=============================

usage:

==================
 = Description: =
==================

Programs used to scan files and folders and tracking words appearance from
word list.

=============================
 = List of submitted files: =
=============================

1. WordExtractor.py - Iterator used to extract each word of a file
2. WordTracker.py - Class used to check each word is it is in word list
3. PathScanner.py - Contains an iterator used to scan files and folders, and
                    functions used to print all sub files and folders of some
                    path and to find a file contain all words of word list
4. README - this file

======================
 = Special Comments =
======================
5. No
6. The complexity of encounter is O(log(n)), because of the binary search
7. The complexity of encounter_all is i O(log(n)), because of the "in" search
   in sorted list
8. The complexity of reset if O(n), because we create a new list size n
   for False
